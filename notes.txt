- In terms of classes, we should make
    - Moves > Pokemon > Team > Player > Battle
- The real application will be an API, the front end should be designed last to interact with the front end
- We'll use an Model View Controller design for this 
- All of our pokemon should be stored in JSON files for easy storage and reading, and to minimize code
